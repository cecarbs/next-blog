## Getting Started

1. Create `.env.local` file in your root folder with the values of:

```javascript
SANITY_DATASET_NAME = YOUR_DATASET_NAME; // sanity website dashboard
SANITY_PROJECT_ID = YOUR_PROJECT_ID; // sanity website dashboard
SANITY_PREVIEW_SECRET_YOUR_PREVIEW_SECRET; // create your own
SANITY_API_TOKEN = YOUR_API_TOKEN; // sanity website dashboard
```

2. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
